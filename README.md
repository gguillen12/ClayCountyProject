# ClayCountyProject
Overview:
This is a group project to create  a web application for the Clay County Historical Museum with an interactive map to search for land deeds as well as a drop down list to view land deeds and generate a table of the information.

Structure: 
We have set up a frontend and backend file to help sort through the data provided by the Clay County Historical Museum. The database that's used in this project is SQLite.
The backend is supported through an API Host server that will help create queries in SQLite and provide the information in the frontend. 

Challenges:
The biggest challenge in this project is having to create a database to sort through a large amount of data with dates that end up with null values in MySQL and Excel; then creating a method to pull this information and provide it in the frontend for the user to view it in a way that is user friendly.
